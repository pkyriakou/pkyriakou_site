My name is Panagiotis. I am from Athens, Greece, but I currently reside in Brussels, Belgium. I am super passionate about all things AI and Data Science. Whether it is some expansive data cleaning at the beginning of a project or a book on AI ethics, be sure that I will be all about it.

I am currently an AI Software Developer at Odoo, a Belgian ERP software company. Before this position, I was a master's student at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. The following sections contain all my academic and professional experiences.

Outside of work (and AI - which does take quite a big part of my free time), I enjoy reading about politics and current affairs, reading literature, listening and playing music, doing and watching sports, and doing some photography.

## Work

### AI Software Developer - Odoo S.A. (2022 - Present)

* Frontend / Backend / AI development using Python, JavaScript, and SQL.
* I was part of the R&D Services team, developing and maintaining Odoo's Project, Planning, Timesheets, Field Service, and Helpdesk apps.
* I developed and reviewed many novel features across all the above-mentioned applications.
* I developed a shift exchange feature for the planning app, allowing employees to easily exchange shifts with each other depending on their availabilities.
* I refactored the planning sharing mechanism ensuring correctness and synchronization between the planning app's front-end view and back-end view.
* I am also part of Odoo's technical recruitment Team, which conducts technical interviews for R&D applicants.

### Student Assistant - Eindhoven University of Technology (2019 - 2020)

* I worked as a tutor for the course "Data Analytics for Engineers".
* I was responsible for a bi-weekly class of around 20-30 students, at which I explained the course material and helped students with their programming exercises.
* My responsibilities also included marking assignments and providing direct feedback to students.

## Education

### MSc Artificial Intelligence - University of Edinburgh (2020 - 2021)

The courses I followed included Vision Computing, Data Mining and Exploration, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Cognitive Neuroscience, and Reinforcement Learning.

I completed my master's thesis as part of the Reinforcement Learning Agents Research Group with the topic: "Reinforcement Learning with Function Approximation in Continuing Tasks: Discounted Return or Average Reward?". You can find more information on my thesis in the **Projects** section of the website.

I graduated in 2021 with Merit.

### BSc Computer Science and Engineering - Eindhoven University of Technology (2017 - 2020)

I followed many courses that focused on computer science concepts such as algorithms, data structures, logic, etc. but most of my elective courses were specifically chosen to be relevant to Data Science and AI. These courses included: Artificial Intelligence, Data Mining and Machine Learning, Data Analytics, Linear Algebra, Medical Image Processing, Cognitive Neuroscience, Datamodelling and Databases, and Data Intensive Systems and Applications.

I also did a collection of courses that focused on the social impact of AI and Robotics which included courses like Social Robots, Rational Agents: Robots & AI, and the final Robots Everywhere research project.

While doing my regular undergraduate studies, I was also part of the Honours Academy, an extracurricular program in which students perform engineering and research projects on a specific domain. I followed the program twice, with my domain being AI and Big Data.

I graduated in 2020 with Cum Laude honors - the highest distinction that the university awards.
